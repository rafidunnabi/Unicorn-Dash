A unicorn (mythical horse) runs over some magical flying hills.
There is a certain amount of gap between two consecutive flying hills.
The unicorn must jump over that gap and properly land on the next hill in order to stay alive.  

The story is not over yet.
Although top of these flying hills are seem to be flat, they might contain some kind of
obstacles (such as giant logs or rocks).
Ancient giant logs are so weak since they are standing for more than thousand years and so,
they can be broken whereas the rocks can’t.
Anyway, the unicorn has to be overpowered to break through the logs.
It’s not possible to break a giant rock so, the unicorn must jump over the rock elsewise it’ll die.

It gets reward (scores) until it’s dead. Moreover, it gets some bonus points when collect some coins.
